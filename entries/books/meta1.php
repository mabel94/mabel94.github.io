  <p>Today, I started reading Metaphysics, Third Edition, by Richard Taylor.  
  	<br>I'm not entirely sure why.  My desk is nested in the "study" of our house, the walls of which are lined with
  	bookshelves, and I saw it right next to my head and picked it up and started reading.  I don't
  	pretend to be overly scientific or "facts-only" when I think about the nature of the earth, simply because
  	I'm that sort of person who thinks any ultimatum or fact asserted with absolute certainty must be wrong or
  	misguided.  In any case, I'm not one of those hyper atheist reddit users who assert the power of "science"*
  	simply because we really don't know very much about anything at all, particularly with regards to the
  	nature of things.
  	<br> So in any case, whether it was by some form of universal providence that I should feel compelled to pick up
  	this book, or instead pure coincidence (or both, which may not be mutually exclusive), I picked it up and started 
  	reading it.  It seems to me like something that I very much need to be reminded of-- that is, the basis of metaphysics.
  	At Cornell and in the world in general, I suppose, it is very easy to get caught up in the lies of what is important
  	and necessary and what is merely helpful or enjoyable.  I don't think money, succes, or security is unimportant,
  	because otherwise, no one would be able to even begin to think about the fundamental issues of life.
  	It's hard to think about why humans exist when the boss of your minimum wage job lays you off and you don't
  	have a way to pay for rent or daycare or food.
  	<br> However, there is still much to be said for not letting these things consume you. I feel as though I've been 
  	doing that too often lately.  The totality of my worth as a human being is my grades, or my future job prospects,
  	or my ability to get out of bed in the morning without wanting to immediately crawl back in and escape into the
  	death-like state that is unneeded sleep.
  	<br> One thing that struck me about this book was the vitriol the author has towards organized religion.
  	It would be funny if the implications weren't so dire for society.  
  	<blockquote>"Many persons, in response to the deep need to be loved, of which we have spoken, have felt themselves 
  		transformed by a mere utterance- such as, for example, "Jesus loves you", as assurance that is cheaply and insincerely
  		flung at them by ambitious evangelists" (page 6)</blockquote>
