  <p>Greetings from Silver IV!  <br> The adrenaline rush you get from crushing the opponent 16:3 is quite remarkable.
  I got 2nd on my team! I think that was arounddddd 23 kills?  I am not sure.  I need to get better at smoking, though.  
  And aiming... and pretty much everything.   
    If it weren't for the fact that it is going on midnight, I would easily be tempted to play 2 or 3 more games tonight.  
    I know, however, that I get progressively worse the more games I play in a row.  I played earlier today with my brother,
    and that game was even more exciting! It ended 16:14 (one loss away from a tie), with both sides trading the win until the very end!
